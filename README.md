# FSPT0024 Fundamentals of Programming - Final Project
This is a course in my foundation year at UTM where we learn the basics of C++ programming language. To test our knowledge and whether we know how to apply our knowledge about C++ programming language or problem-solving techniques in general, we are given a study case question and required to:
- analyze the input, process, and output
- create a flowchart
- write a C++ program
based on the study case that has been given

(This is a group project by the way)
