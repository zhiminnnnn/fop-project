# Reflection
1. Putting Theory into Practice

   We used many programming concepts we learned in class. For instance, the `calcFee()` and `getDisc()` functions helped us organize the code neatly. Using arrays was challenging but necessary to store all the course information, participants, fees, and so on.

2. Problem-Solving and Attention to Detail

   We faced some tricky problems. For example, we need to make sure the program didn't crash if the user typed an invalid input. We also added a check to prevent users from registering for the same course twice. Fixing these issues taught me to think carefully about how a user might interact with our program and to plan for mistakes.

3. Teamwork Made it Work

   This project wasn't just about coding. We had to work together to design the flowchart, write the report, and prepare the presentation. It showed me how important teamwork and clear communication are in order to success.

In conclusion, I learned that programming is more than just writing codes. It's also about solving a problem including planning, coding, testing, and presenting. I now feel more confident in my ability to build a useful program and work effectively in a team.
