# Reflection
After finishing this project, I feel proud of what our group accomplished. Writing the code for the IT UTM Consultancy system was a big task, and I learned a lot.

1. Putting Theory into Practice

   We used many programming concepts we learned in class. Creating the `calcFee()` and `getDisc()` functions helped us organize the code neatly. Using arrays was challenging but necessary to store all the course information, participants, and fees. It was satisfying to see how loops could print the long receipt automatically.

2. Problem-Solving and Attention to Detail

   We faced some tricky problems. For example, we had to make sure the program didn't crash if the user typed a word instead of a number. We also added a check to prevent users from registering for the same course twice. Fixing these issues taught me to think carefully about how a user might interact with our program and to plan for mistakes.

3. Teamwork Made it Work

   This project wasn't just about coding. We had to work together to plan the flowchart, write the report, and prepare the presentation. Seeing our separate pieces of work come together into a final program and report showed me how important teamwork and clear communication are for success.

In conclusion, this project showed me that programming is more than just writing lines of code. It's about solving a problem from start to finish, which includes planning, coding, testing, and presenting. I now feel more confident in my ability to build a useful program and work effectively in a team.
